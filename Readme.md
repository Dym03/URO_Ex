## Important Dates
- ## Sketch 
    - ### Hand sketched or using a program, I don't really mind any of those. Should have 1 main window (complex, with atleast a few widgets and a form) and 2-3 subwindows (simple). Should be handed over in Kelvin due to next week, not a hard deadline but the quicker the less stress for you.
- ## First project presentation (Tkinter) (10 - 25)
    - ### Monday Exercise: 9.3
    - ### Tuesday Exercise: 10.3 Might be delayed due to VSB activities | Online
- ## Second project presentation (Qt/C++) (15- 30)
    - ### Monday Exercise: 6.4 Might be delayed due to VSB activities | Online
    - ### Tuesday Exercise: 7.4 
- ## Third project presentation (Bootstrap) (5 - 20)
    - ### Projects might be done in other frameworks if you are familiar with them, I dont mind, they are just not going to be taught at the exercices
    -  ### Monday Exercise: 11.5
    -  ### Tuesday Exercise: 12.5

## Exercices
- ### I will try to upload code from the exercies here on github so you can use what we have created during the exercise
- ### As far as the points from the exercices, I think you have a lot of other things to do. So if you test the things out in the project, the points from the exercices lose purpose as the assignments are almost always part of your project. So they will be added accordingly to the max of the projects. This might change if any of you or supervisor raise any objections.

## AI usage
### These project are far from being hard, I believe that all of you should be able to write them yourself, but no one will be punished for using AI, but I would like to note that during the presentation I would like you to understand the code you are presenting, and you are able to make minor changes to the look or functionality. Also note that what you learn now, might be useful later, and now is the time to test things with trial and error, and later in work this might not be possible.

## Thought
### Not all of us were born to be designers, but all of us were born people. So please I would like you to make programs that people would be able to use comfortably. As far as the points go, if you are not feeling comfortable in the design part, make the fuctionality part stand out. Last but not least, keep it simple, don't make your life too complicated. I would rather use simple GUI with good functionality, rather than beautiful GUI that is functionless.
