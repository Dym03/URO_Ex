## AI usage
### These project are far from being hard, I believe that all of you should be able to write them yourself, but I will not be punishing anyone using AI, but I would like to note that during the presentation I would like you to understand the code you are presenting, and you are able to make minor changes to the look or functionality. Also note that what you learn now, might be usefull later, and now is the time to test things with trial and error, and later in work this might not be possible.

## Thought
### Not all of us were born to be designers, but all of us were born people. So please I would like you to make programs that people would be able to use comfortably. As far as the points go, if you are not feeling comfortable in the design part, make the fuctionality part stand out. Last but not least, keep it simple, don't make your life too complicated. I would rather use simple GUI with good functionality, rather than beautiful GUI that is functionless.
